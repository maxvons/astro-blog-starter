# ðŸš€ Astro Blog

A simple Astro blog template with sensible defaults, DX improvements, and instructions to get a new blog up and running as quickly as possible.

The template includes detailed instructions for getting started, customizing things to your liking, and eventually deploying the blog.

## Getting started

To get started with this template, you need to create your own repository and clone it.

### Creating your own repository

This repository has been initialized as a template repository, so to create your own repository and Astro blog you can simply follow the guide below:

1. Press the "Use this template" button in the top right corner and choose "Create a new repository".
2. In the "Create a new repository" menu, choose a name and optional description for your new blog, and choose if you want to make it public or private.
3. Clone the repo as usual and get started!

### Installing dependencies and starting the blog

For the purposes of this document, I will assume that you use `bun`.

If you don't already have `bun` installed, you can install the latest version on the [Bun website](https://bun.sh).

Assuming you use macOS, you can simply run the script below:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

And then either restart your terminal or source your shell config file.

For Zsh (macOS default):

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then navigate to the project root (where `package.json` is located) and install the required dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Finally, start and run the blog locally:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This will start the local Astro dev server at `localhost:4321`.

To view the blog in a browser, simply click the link in the terminal or input `localhost:4321` in the address field of your browser of choice.

## Features

### Supports light and dark mode

The template includes support for both light and dark mode based on user preferences through the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature. All color customization options have been defined as CSS variables in `src/styles/global.css`, so you can just update these to match your preferred color scheme.

### Fonts included

This template includes the following two fonts:

- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
- [Bricolage Grotesque](https://ateliertriay.github.io/bricolage/)

Inter and Bricolage Grotesque are both very popular and available as [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts) with [optical sizing](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_sizes) which means you can define whatever supported weight and font size you want, and the font will adapt to look as good as possible at that size.

#### How to use the fonts

Inter can be used for both headings and body textâ€”especially since it was updated with optical sizingâ€”however, I recommend using this font for body text and anything else that isn't headers.

Bricolage Grotesque _can_ be used for both headings and body text, but I would recommend that you use this font for headings, as it can become a bit too distracting for body textâ€”especially for a blog.

I have defined the following CSS variables related to the fonts:

- `--primary-font`
- `--header-font`

`--primary-font` has been configured to use the Inter variable font The intended usage is anything other than headers. You most likely won't need to define this for components since it will already be defined for most text styles in `global.css`.

`--header-font` has been configured to use the Bricolage Grotesque variable font. The intended usage is headers.

### Automatic formatting

`prettier` has been added as a dev dependency for automatic formatting support. You can format all the applicable files in the project using the following command:

```sh
bun run format
```

If you prefer to check which files are unformatted and formatting them yourself, you can run:

```sh
bun run format-check
```

If you use VS Code, I strongly suggest that you install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and add a local `.vscode` folder with a `settings.json` file with the following contents:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

This will ensure that your files are formatted as you work on them when saving.

In addition to the prettier dependency, I have added [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) with a commit hook to support formatting staged files on commit. This ensures that only the files that were changed and are part of the commit are formatted before committing and eventually pushing the changes. This way you introduce less unformatted files in your codebase if you forget to run the formatting scripts before committing and pushing your changes.

If you want, you can of course remove either of these dependencies. This is described in more detail in the "Misc. section".

Features:

- âœ… Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- âœ… 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- âœ… SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- âœ… Sitemap support
- âœ… RSS Feed support
- âœ… Markdown & MDX support

## Styling setup

I prefer to style most of my Astro components using the `<style>` tag directly in the component. This keeps the styles as close to the component and markup as possible while avoiding clutter in the markup through a ton of utility classes. This template has therefore been designed with this in mind. If you prefer a different setupâ€”for example something like Tailwind CSSâ€”you will need to configure that yourself. Please see the relevant section "Adding support for Tailwind CSS" if you want to do this.

### Global styles

There are some global styles that have been defined in `styles/global.css`.

In my experience, the styling for header and text tags are mostly the same throughout the site unless you specifically want something else, so I have decided to style the most common header and text tags here. The same is true for anchor tags. I have also defined the styles for the universal background color and stuff like that.

### Mixins

In my experience, there are some CSS snippets/patterns that are used more than othersâ€”for example media queries and some layout styles. Instead of defining the same styling for each component, you can define something called a "mixin" where you put the relevant CSS and import it where you want to use it. This is basically to CSS what functions are for most programming languagesâ€”reusable logic that you can use multiple places.

For this template, I have created a file called `mixins.css` where I have put some mixins that I deem useful and use often. For example common media queries and some layout patterns:

```css
@define-mixin tablet {
  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}

@define-mixin desktop {
  @media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}

@define-mixin center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

You can then import these mixins in other css files or directly in `style` tags part of Astro components. You can see the effect of mixins below.

**Without mixin:**

```css
<style>
  padding: 8px 12px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  @media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
      padding: 12px 16px
  }
</style>
```

**With mixin:**

```css
<style>
  @import "src/styles/mixins.css";

  padding: 8px 12px;
  @mixin center;

  @mixin desktop {
    padding: 12px 16px
  }
</style>
```

Mixins are currently not natively supported by CSS, but a feature part of many CSS pre- or postprocessors, such as [Saas](https://sass-lang.com) or [PostCSS](https://postcss.org).

Since [Astro comes with PostCSS included](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#postcss), and I don't have any use for most of the Saas features, this template uses a PostCSS plugin called [`postcss-mixins`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-mixins). This has been added as a dev dependency and can be removed if you don't have any use for mixins.

### Vendor prefixes

In addition to `postcss-mixins`, the template includes the [PostCSS `autoprefixer` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer). This plugin automatically adds [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) to your CSS, so you don't have to think about that. You just write CSS, and it will work across most browsers.

`autoprefixer` uses data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply prefixes. In this template, this is defined using the `browserslist` property in `package.json` where I have decided to use the `defaults` value. This gives a reasonable configuration for most users. Feel free to change or remove this if you know what you're doing.

### Adding support for Tailwind CSS

TODO: Describe how to add support for Tailwind here.

## Project Structure

TODO: Briefly explain the project structure, including the various files and folders.

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

I have made the choice to place local font files in `public/fonts` and images in `public/images`, but you can change this to your preferences.
