# 🚀 Astro Blog

This is a simple Astro blog template created by [Maximilian von Stephanides](https://www.maximilian.no) with sensible defaults and DX improvements to get a new blog up and running quickly.

The starting point for the template was created with the `create astro` setup wizard and the [blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/) that you can choose during configuration there.

The template includes detailed instructions for getting started, customizing things to your liking, and eventually deploying the blog.

## Getting started

To get started with this template, you need to create your own repository and clone it.

### Creating your own repository

This repository has been initialized as a template repository, so to create your own repository and Astro blog you can simply follow the guide below:

1. Press the "Use this template" button in the top right corner and choose "Create a new repository".
2. In the "Create a new repository" menu, choose a name and optional description for your new blog, and choose if you want to make it public or private.
3. Clone the repo as usual and get started!

### Installing dependencies and starting the blog

For the purposes of this document, I will assume that you use `npm`.

First install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then start and run the blog locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the local Astro dev server at `localhost:4321`.

To view the blog in a browser, simply click the link in the terminal or input `localhost:4321` in the address field of your browser of choice.

## Features

### Supports light and dark mode

The template includes support for both light and dark mode based on user preferences through the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature. All color customization options have been defined as CSS variables in `src/styles/global.css`, so you can just update these to match your preferred color scheme.

### Support for variable font files

### Automatic formatting

`prettier` has been added as a dev dependency for automatic formatting support. You can format all the applicable files in the project using the following command:

```sh
npm run format
```

If you prefer to check which files are unformatted and formatting them yourself, you can run:

```sh
npm run format-check
```

If you use VS Code, I strongly suggest that you install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and add a local `.vscode` folder with a `settings.json` file and add the following contents:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

This will ensure that your files are formatted as you work on them when saving.

In addition to the prettier dependency, I have added `husky` to support formatting staged files when committing.

#### Removing formatting support

If you want, you can of course remove either of these dependencies.

**Removing Prettier**

To remove the Prettier dependency, follow the steps below:

1. Run `npm uninstall prettier prettier-plugin-astro`
2. Delete the `.prettierrc.js` file
3. Delete the `format` and `format-check` scripts from `package.json`
4. Delete the contents of the `pre-commit` husky file

**Removing Husky**

To remove the Husky dependency, follow the steps below:

1. Run `npm uninstall husky`
2. Delete the `.husky` folder
3. Delete the `prepare` script from `package.json`

Features:

- ✅ Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- ✅ 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- ✅ SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- ✅ Sitemap support
- ✅ RSS Feed support
- ✅ Markdown & MDX support

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

I have made the choice to place local font files in `public/fonts` and images in `public/images`, but you can change this to your preferences.

## Commands

Commands are run from the root of the project:
